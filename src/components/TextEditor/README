# What i have learned from designing the TextEditor

1. **Read ALL the documentation**

- Try to read all the documentation of the library you are using, if you don't have time, skim it, or search for keyword.
- Why? Because it may contains the solution for the problems you are facing.
- Example 1: I try to focus the Editable components they provide by using useRef, they provide the `ReactEditor.focus()`
- Example 2: Passing editor down to lower components using props, they provide the `useSlate()` hook.
